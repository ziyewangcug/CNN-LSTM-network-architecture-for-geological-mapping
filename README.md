**Abstract**

Application of convolutional recurrent neural networks for geological feature mapping based on geochemical exploration data.

-   This python code uses cross validation to tune the model and to find the optimal hyperparameters.
-   The input geochemical data include training and testing samples, in which training samples are split into positive training data and negative training data, formatted as the example file.
-   The output result is also formatted as a two-dimensional matrix including the locations of samples and the corresponding probability of target geological feature occurrence.

**Environment**

-   Python 3.7
-   TensorFlow 2.1
-   Keras 1.2.1
-   Numpy 1.15.0
-   Pandas 1.1

**Input dataset (example)**
